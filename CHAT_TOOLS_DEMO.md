# CyberForget Chat Tools Demo

## 🎯 What We've Built

I've successfully created a **modular chat-integrated tool system** that embeds all your free security tools directly into the ChatPage. Users no longer need to navigate to separate pages - everything is accessible within the chat conversation.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Command-Based Tool Access
Users can type commands directly in chat:
```
/password-check
/email-breach
/data-broker-scan
/file-scan
/delete-account
/area-code
```

### 2. Natural Language Triggers
The system detects intent from natural language:
```
"check my password"          → Opens Password Checker
"scan my email for breaches" → Opens Email Breach Scanner
"find my data on brokers"    → Opens Data Broker Scanner
"scan this file for viruses" → Opens File Scanner
```

### 3. Visual Tool Manager
Click the 🛠️ button (bottom-right) to see all available tools in a grid layout.
