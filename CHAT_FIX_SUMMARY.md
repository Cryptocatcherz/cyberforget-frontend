# Chat Tool Auto-Navigation Fix

## Problem
When users clicked premade questions like "Analyze my digital footprint and security posture", the system was:
1. Showing the AI response with tool suggestion buttons 
2. AND also auto-opening the tool
3. This created confusion with duplicate tool suggestions

## Solution
Modified `handlePreMadeQuestionClick` in `useChat.js` to:
- Check if the premade question has a `toolType` 
- If it does, immediately navigate to the appropriate tool page
- Skip showing AI response with duplicate tool suggestions

## Code Changes

### File: `/src/hooks/useChat.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
const handlePreMadeQuestionClick = useCallback(async (question) => {
    const enhancedQuestion = enhanceQuestionWithContext(question);
    await processMessage(enhancedQuestion);
}, [processMessage]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handlePreMadeQuestionClick = useCallback(async (question, options) => {
    // Check if this is a premade question that should auto-navigate to a tool
    if (options && options.toolType) {
        const toolMapping = {
            'data_broker_scan': '/location',
            'email_breach': '/data-leak', 
            'password_checker': '/password-check',
            'comprehensive_security': '/location',
            'ai_defense': '/scamai',
            'network_scan': '/location'
        };
        
        const targetUrl = toolMapping[options.toolType];
        if (targetUrl) {
            // Auto-navigate to the tool instead of showing suggestions
            navigate(targetUrl);
            return;
        }
    }
    
    // Enhanced tool matching for premade questions
    const enhancedQuestion = enhanceQuestionWithContext(question);
    await processMessage(enhancedQuestion);
}, [processMessage, navigate]);
```

## Tool Mapping
- `data_broker_scan` → `/location` (Data Broker Scanner)
- `email_breach` → `/data-leak` (Email Breach Checker)
- `password_checker` → `/password-check` (Password Checker)
- `comprehensive_security` → `/location` (Comprehensive Security Scan)
- `ai_defense` → `/scamai` (AI Defense Strategies)
- `network_scan` → `/location` (Network Vulnerability Scan)

## Result
Now when users click premade questions, they will:
1. Immediately navigate to the appropriate tool
2. No longer see duplicate tool suggestion buttons
3. Have a cleaner, more direct user experience

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Go to the chat page
2. Click "Analyze my digital footprint and security posture"  
3. Should immediately navigate to `/location` (Data Broker Scanner)
4. No tool suggestion buttons should appear in chat

This eliminates the confusion you described where users saw both the tool suggestion button AND the opened tool.
